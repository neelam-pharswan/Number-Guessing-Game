Instructions to Play the Number Guessing Game

    Start the Game
        Run the Python script to begin the game. A random number between 0 and 10 will be generated by the computer (hidden from you).

    Objective
        Your goal is to guess the randomly generated number within 4 attempts.

    Making a Guess
        When prompted, enter a number between 0 and 10 and press Enter. Ensure your input is a valid integer.
        If you enter a number outside of the range (0-10), you will receive a message prompting you to enter a valid number.

    Feedback on Your Guess
        After each guess, you will receive feedback:
            If your guess is higher than the computer's number, you'll see: "High Guess!!!"
            If your guess is lower than the computer's number, you'll see: "Too Low!!!"
            If you guess the correct number, youâ€™ll see: "You Won!!!", and the game will end immediately.

    Attempt Limit
        You have a total of 4 attempts to guess the number. If you use all your attempts without guessing correctly, the game will reveal the correct number and display: "Game Over! Good luck next time :)".

    Play Again
        You can restart the game by running the script again to try guessing a new random number.

Enjoy testing your guessing skills, and good luck!
